Conflict resolution is a multistage sorting process. The first step in the process
is to gather the style specifications from the three possible levels of style sheets.
These specifications are sorted into order by the relative precedence of the style
sheet levels. Next, all the available specifications (those from style sheets, those from
the user, and those from the browser) are sorted by origin and weight in accordance
with the following list of rules, in which the first has the highest precedence:
	1. Important declarations with user origin
	2. Important declarations with author origin
	3. Normal declarations with author origin
	4. Normal declarations with user origin
	5. Any declarations with browser (or other user agent) origin
Note that user-origin specifications are considered to have the highest precedence.
The rationale for this approach is that such specifications often are
declared because of some diminished capability of the user, most often a visual
impairment.
If there are conflicts after this first sorting takes place, the next step in their
resolution is a sort by specificity. This sort is based on the following rules, in
which the first has the highest precedence:
	1. id selectors
	2. Class and pseudo class selectors
	3. Contextual selectors (more element type names means that they are more
	specific)
	4. Universal selectors
If there are still conflicts, they are resolved by giving precedence to the most
recently seen specification. For this process, the specifications in an external style
sheet are considered to occur at the point in the document where the link element
or @import rule that references the external style sheet appears. For example, if
a style sheet specifies the following, and there are no further conflicting specifications
before the element is displayed, the value used will be the last (in this
case, 0.9em):
	p {font-size: 1em}
	p {font-size: 0.9em}
The whole sorting process that is used to resolve style specification
conflicts is called the cascade. The name is apropos because the rules apply the
lowest priority styles first and then cascade progressively to those with higher
priorities.
